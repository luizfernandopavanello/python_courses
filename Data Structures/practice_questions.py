"""Practice Questions

The following questions are based on the same text you saw in the last lesson, the first verse of the poem If by Rudyard Kipling. We've converted all letters to lowercase, removed punctuation marks from the text, and stored this modified text in the string variable verse.
Quiz: Count Unique Words

Your task for this quiz is to find the number of unique words in the text. 

    1. Split verse into a list of words. Hint: You can use a string method you learned in the previous lesson.
    2. Convert the list into a data structure that would keep only the unique elements from the list.
    3. Print the length of the container.
